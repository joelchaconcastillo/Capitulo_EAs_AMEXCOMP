Alex Kai Qin is a very active researcher in the fields of Evolutionary Computation and Differential Evolution. Among his many contributions, Self-adaptive Differential Evolution (SaDE) is probably one of the most well-known ones. Given the close relationship between our methods, and the adaptation of the mutation scale factor, in our paper we compare our methods against some of the ideas used in SaDE. For this reason, we consider that A. K. Qin might be a proper reviewer for our paper. To our knowledge, he is currently working at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. His e-mail is qinkai@pmail.ntu.edu.sg

Daniela Zaharie is an active researcher in the fields of evolutionary computation, differential evolution and multi-agent systems. She has developed several important studies on the crossover of differential evolution, on the management of diversity and on the explorative behavior of differential evolution. Previous topics are closely related to the advances presented in our paper. For this reason, in our opinion she is an adequate reviewer for our paper. To our knowledge, she is currently working at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, West University of Timis. Her e-mail is dzaharie@info.uvt.ro

Arthur C. Sanderson is a very active researcher in the field of Evolutionary Computation, with more than 40 publications in high-quality journals. Among his contributions, JADE is probably one of the most well-known ones. In addition, he has also several contributions on large-scale optimization. Given the close relationship between his works and our paper, we have provided some comparisons against JADE. As a result, in our opinion he is a proper reviewer for our paper. To our knowledge, he is currently working at the Department of Computer and Systems Engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy. His e-mail is sandea@rpi.edu
